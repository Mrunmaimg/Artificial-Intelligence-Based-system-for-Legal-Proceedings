# Artificial Intelligence-Based System for Legal Proceedings

## Overview
The **Artificial Intelligence-Based System for Legal Proceedings** is an innovative platform leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to revolutionize the legal domain. This system integrates transcription, translation, and summarization capabilities to address linguistic barriers, streamline legal research, and enhance accessibility in multilingual legal systems.

## Features
- **Real-Time Hindi-to-English Transcription:** Accurate speech recognition and transcription for legal proceedings.
- **Judgment Summarization:** Condenses lengthy legal judgments into concise, actionable summaries.
- **Legal Document Translation:** Translates English legal documents into Hindi, preserving context and terminology.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for legal professionals to utilize AI capabilities efficiently.
- **Scalability:** Extensible architecture for incorporating additional languages and legal applications.

## System Architecture
The system comprises three integrated modules:
1. **Transcription Module:** Converts Hindi speech to text using a Speech-to-Text (STT) model.
2. **Translation Module:** Employs Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for Hindi-to-English and English-to-Hindi document translation.
3. **Summarization Module:** Generates concise summaries of legal judgments using NLP models like transformers.
